[Lab 1 - Trainspotting](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2014/course/TDA382/lab1.html) [*Java*]
------

> In this assignment you will use semaphores to write a program to control two trains. The purpose is to write the program so that the trains move relatively independently of each other, but without colliding. Instead of a real railway, we have a simulator, where one can control the speeds of trains and change rail switches. The simulator gives a signal when a train passes sensors suitably placed on the tracks. It is part of the assignment to decide where sensors should be placed to give sufficient information for your program.


[Lab 2 - Trainspotting II](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2014/course/TDA382/lab2.html) [*Java*]
------

> In this assignment, you will implement a variation of the program to control the two trains that uses monitors rather than semaphores.


[Lab 3 - CCHAT](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2014/course/TDA382/cchat.html) [*Erlang*]
------

> CCHAT is a simple text-based messaging system and is inspired by IRC, an old but still valid standard designed for group discussions. For simplicity, and reasons of time, the implementation of CCHAT is not going to use IRC's protocol nor low-level TCP/IP communication. Instead, it will leverage Erlang's processes and message passing features.
