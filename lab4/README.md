Lab 4 - DCHAT
=========================

> This lab is basically an adaptation of CCHAT (Lab 3) for a distributed environment. DCHAT will use the same arquitecture, ie a client-server architecture. However, now the client process (and the GUI) should be able to communicate with a server located in another Erlang node (maybe on a different computer).
